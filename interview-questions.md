6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
hoisting allows variables to be impelmented at any point in your code, regardless of where they are listed. 

  Researched answer:

hoisting takes the declarations and hoists them to the top of the code, but not the values. therefore, if you define a variable after you console.log, you will recieve a value of undefined, instead of a syntax error. 
in the case of functions, if you declare a name to your function and you console.log before the line where your function is declared, you will still console.log the return of your function, as it has been declared a name. 
if you do not name your funciton, and try to console.log before your function is declared, you will recieve a syntax error.
